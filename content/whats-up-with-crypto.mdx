It was 7 AM, a brisk, overcast Monday. 29 year old Rachel Siegel had left her Lower East Side apartment to the subway. She was on her way to the public school where she worked as a subsitute teacher.

8:30: First period. 9:30: Second period. And the next, and the next. Rachel sat in her classroom, talking to students, watching them. She ate lunch, and then resumed teaching for the afternoon classes.

It seemed to be another normal day in the life of a substitute teacher, but there was something different about this particular Monday for Rachel. A cryptocurrency conference was being held in New York City.

This in itself was nothing out of the ordinary; New York City had seen probably hundreds of similar conferences before, but to Rachel, it certainly was not an everyday occurence.
She had been invited to the conference's after-party by her friend, despite her having never paid much attention to cryptocurrency.

But at that conference, she met people who were experienced, passionate, and confident about cryptocurrency, and that's all it took for Rachel to become convinced in cryptocurrency as an investment.

She began her investments by taking whatever was left from her substitute teacher paycheck--often less than $25 a week.

Less than five years later, Rachel is a millionare.<sup><a href='https://nypost.com/2022/02/05/how-cryptocurrency-made-these-four-ordinary-people-rich/' target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>

Jered Kenna. Peter Saddington. Erick Fineman. Kane Ellis. Cryptocurrency rags-to-riches stories are not at all difficult to find. 

These stories of ordinary people making extraordinary money with little knowledge or effort combined with the intense media focus on cryptocurrency and the constant price increases of cryptocurrencies has led to a cryptocurrency craze over the past several years.
You don't need to be a cryptocurrency expert, a software engineer, or even a tech-savvy person to realize your financial freedom--you just need some money and some faith.

What used to be a virtually unknown, poorly understood technical innovation is now the largest, most accessible economic opportunity.

## The Rise of Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency can be traced as far back as the early 1980s--in 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived an anonymous cryptographic electronic currency that he called ecash, which he later implemented as DigiCash in 1989.<sup><a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a.html?sh=34bf4d99715f" target="blank">[2]</a></sup>
Digicash designated encrypted keys for money to be transferred, and thus allowed for Digicash to be untraceable.

Other forms of electronic currencies popped up throughout the 90s (most notably b-money and bitgold), but it wasn't until 2009, when bitcoin was created that cryptocurrency would take off and eventually hit the mainstream.

But what made bitcoin different from those that preceded it?

Thought up by Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin, similarly to its predecessors, required users to complete a <a href="" target="_blank">proof-of-work</a>--however, it pioneered its use as a method to determine consensus in a decentralized system in order for blocks to be appended to the blockchain and for miners to receive bitcoin.

This meant that bitcoin was the world's first **decentralized** cryptocurrency. It wasn't long before a number of other decentralized cryptocurrencies cropped up as well, following the groundwork laid by bitcoin for the next revolution of digital currency.

## Defining the Technology

Before we can define cryptocurrency, before we can know *how* it works, we must be clear about *why* it exists. 

When David Chaum created <a href="" target="_blank">ecash/DigiCash</a> in the 1980s, he wanted to create a digital currency that was untraceable, anonymous, secure, and seamless. There would be no way for the currency to be tracked, there would be no way to link withdrawals and transactions, there would be no need to open separate accounts for each vendor, and there would be no required transmission of confidential information (ie. credit card numbers).

It was meant to be a better way for people to transact on the new internet, one focused on the importance of privacy.

As the internet continued to evolve and grow, this notion of privacy for the users of the internet became a most important pillar amongst a small group of people. 

They, unlike the majority of internet users, saw the lack of privacy and the centralized nature of the internet as fundamental issues. 

And what better way than cryptocurrency to address privacy, security, freedom, and anonymity in perhaps the most important interaction on the internet: payment.

Despite scholars, computer scientists, and cryptographers commonly disagreeing with each other on the specific characteristics and attributes that define a cryptocurrency, <a href="" target="_blank">there exists a general-enough consensus to loosely define a cyptocurrency system as one that</a>:
- is untraceable and distributed (ie. no central authority)
- defines how cryptocurrency units can be created, if at all
- ownership of and transactions of cryptocurrency units must be verified cryptographically (eg. encrypted keys)
- ownership of cyptocurrency units can be transferred, where transactions can only be issued when ownership of unit is proven

### Blockchain

While early cryptocurrencies were still centralized (ie. single issuer of currency), bitcoin began the trend of decentralized cryptocurrencies.

In a decentralized cryptocurrency system, each cryptocurrency is part of a distributed ledger, most commonly a <a href="" target="_blank">blockchain</a>.

In a blockchain, each transaction is recorded as a block; the block contains data related to the transaction: the timestamp, transaction data, and the hash (location) of the previous block. This essentially creates a public record of all transactions, 
and more importantly, a record that is very difficult to change. 

As the blocks are linked together, each containing information about the previous block, they form a chain, with earlier blocks reinforced by the blocks succeeding it. As a result, in order to retroactively change one record (block), all of the blocks in the chain after it must also be altered as well.

### Timestamping

For a transaction to be recognized, it must be present in the blockchain. In order for it to be appended to the blockchain, it must be validated first; this validation must also be secure from malicious validators.

It is crucial that cryptocurrency transactions can be verified without requiring a third party to do so. For any trust in a third party--even the owner of the sytem--is a threat to the cryptocurrency's integrity.

But how can each transaction be verified in a manner that is both trustworthy yet also trust-less?

### Proof-of-work

[Proof-of-work]() is a cryptographic proof that allows someone to prove to others that a certain amount of computational effort has been expended. This computation can then be easily verified by others.

Contrary to its name, however, proof-of-work is less about proving that some work was carried out, but rather more about deterring large attacks (kind of like spam or in the case of cryptocurrency, manipulation attempts)
by requiring some effort, energy, and hardware beforehand. 

This effort or work must be carefully decided though: it must be hard enough to deter large attacks, but not too difficult that legitimate requests are still possible and very easy for people to verify.

Each transaction must go through a verification scheme before it is appended to the blockchain: difficult hashing algorithms must be computed, requiring large amounts of energy, computational hardware, and time.

But how are these hashing algorithms solved? After all, someone needs to solve them for the transaction to be validated, but not everybody transferring bitcoin has the means to do so.

This is where mining comes in. Rather than making the parties directly involved in the transaction have to verify it themselves, other people on the network can do it for them.
And in order to incentivize other people to compute these hash functions, bitcoin rewards them by giving them bitcoin. 

It's all a perfect loop: People mine cryptocurrencies so that they can use them in transactions, and in that process they also help verify other's bitcoin transactions.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>

Since bitcoin, nearly all cryptocurrencies following it have also employed the very same timestamping scheme to validagte transactions in a decentralized network. But in recent years especially, a different scheme has seen greater and greater use.

### Proof-of-stake

In a proof-of-work scheme, consensus that a transaction is legitimate is acheived by requiring large amounts of computational expenditure.
An attacker would need to acquire a large fraction of the computational power of the validator network before their illegitimate transaction could go through.

[Proof-of-stake](), on the other hand, accomplishes the verification of transactions by requiring validators to already own some quantity of blockchain tokens.
If an attacker wants to verify illegitimate transactions, they must first acquire, not computational power, but a large enough fraction of tokens.

Although a consensus model that relies on the number of cryptocurrency owned compared to the amount of work expended can be argued to be not only less secure but also more unequal (creates a trend towards large shareholders),
the primary benefit of the PoS mechanism is that it has no intrinsic energy requirement. As for PoW and all of the energy consumption it creates, well, let's just say it isn't very good for the environment.

But we'll touch on that later.

## Crypto Economics

On January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of the bitcoin blockchain. Embedded in this first block was the following: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks."
On the same day, Nakamoto released bitcoin's source code, along with a 500-word essay. "The root problem with conventional currencies is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>

It's important to recognize the value that cryptocurrency can provide. A dencentralized, distributed, anonymous (or psudenymous), secure digital currency is something that will become even more necessary as our lives become increasingly online.

It provides a different form of money, one that we have never had before, one that potentially rectifies many flaws in our current system. 

At the same time, cryptocurrency has become more than just a new and improved form of currency, it has become an asset, an investment.

Although it is true that early cryptocurrency proponents likely saw the value of cryptocurrency as a way to hold value against the instability of centralized fiat currencies,
the current state of cryptocurrency has no doubt stretched much further beyond what they ever envisioned.

The simple fact that cannot be ignored is, nearly everyone buying cryptocurrencies today know little to nothing about what they are buying, not to mention the underlying innovation and promise of cryptocurrency.

It is nothing more than an asset they expect to appreciate, not much unlike a house, or a stock, or a bond. While people are likely aware that houses, stocks, and bonds have some intrisic value, are these people investing in crypto as aware of the intrinsic value of the coins they invest in?

It seems a scary parallel to the unchecked belief in the infallibility of the housing market in the early 2000s, but people purchase these coins (and increasingly speculative alternative coins as well) because they want to exit with more money in their pocket--not because they believe
there's something wrong with the current financial system, not because they believe that cryptocurrency will be a necessary part of the future.

Cryptocurrency then, is not an investment into the future for what's right or what's better, but an investment for what's current. They use these cryptocurrencies as a means to increase wealth--in fiat currencies.

But that defeats the whole point, does it not? People should be using cryptocurrency as a means to get away from the fiat currency, not as a means to increase their holdings of the very thing cryptocurrency is meant to rid.

It's vital to recognize the separation of cryptocurrency's value as a technology or innovation (the blockchain, the proof-of-work, the decentralized and distributed architecture) and it's use as a financial asset.

Does the current value of the cryptocurrency industry accurately reflect its instrinsic technological utility? Beware cryptocurrency as an investment, especially if you aren't sure how to answer.

## Sustainability and the Future

Will cryptocurrency become the world's future currency? Can it work on such a scale? These aren't straightforward questions to answer.

Although there is undeniable value, there are also many factors that make such a future quite difficult.

Cryptocurrencies currently cause <a href="" target="_blank">nearly 0.2% of the world's annual greenhouse gases emissions</a>. The amount of computational work the verification of cryptocurrency transactions means that miners need to use powerful machinery (read: GPUs). 

It just so happens that powerful computers consume a lot of electricity, and most of the world's electricity (especially in less developed countries) is generated through greenhouse cases--coal, in particular, which also just so happens to be the most polluting of the greenhouse gases.

As the developed world tries to move to a cleaner, greener, more sustainable future, cryptocurrency as it stands is under threat.

Governments around the world have already been cracking down on cryptocurrency for this precise reason: just last year, China (the world's biggest cryptocurrency market at that point in time by quite some margin) <a href="" target="_blank">banned all cryptocurrency transactions</a>, in large part due to the highly polluting nature of cryptocurrencies' proof-of-work scheme.

And speaking of government crackdowns, nearly every developed nation has placed (or is trying to place) heavier restrictions on crypto. Obviously, governments are not exactly supporters of cryptocurrencies' untraceable, anonymous nature, and the highly publicized use of bitcoin on the dark web to launder money and make illegal purchases doesn't help.
And of course, it is no surprise that governments see cryptocurrency as a threat to their power--the government would be be pretty useless without its control over national currency.

But from a more technical perspective, there are major feasibility concerns with large-scale cryptocurrencies.

It is difficult to imagine a harmonious ecosystem of many cryptocurrencies all be traded and used together. For effective exchanges, it would do good to have a standard (kind of like the gold standard).
But that would mean a third-party currency which would end up determining the value of cryptocurrencies, and that kind of makes part of the cryptocurrency useless. Cryptocurrencies are meant to defeat the fiat currency and the central banks, not enable them.

It would be much better if there was only once currency that everyone used; then every transaction would be seamless and there would be no such exchanging issues. Of course, this is even more unlikely--for some reason, I doubt people would let one cryptocurrency to become the de facto currency willingly, especially creators of other cyptocurrencies.

Then there is the issue of speed. The production of hashes are unfortunately slow. It takes 10 minutes for bitcoin to process a block--that's 10 minutes for every transaction to be confirmed. 

Even others coins, such as Litecoin and Ether, which aim to process transactions faster (Litecoin takes 2.5 minutes to process each block, while Ether takes 12 seconds), remain painfully slower than current centralized transaction systems.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>

Part of the problem is the proof-of-work mechanism, which by its nature is meant to be slow and laborious, but even PoS-based blockchains cannot compete with Visa. 

While Visa can process close to 50,000 transactions a second, Ethereum (currently the most used blockchain) can only process 25 every second.<sup><a href="" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>

Sure, it's true that Ethereum still uses a proof-of-work mechanism and it's planned implementations of a proof-of-stake mechanism and sharding will undoubtedly improve performance, it's undeniable that decentralized applications are just less efficient. That's just how it works, and it doesn't take a lot of intelligence to see why.

### Non-fungible Tokens

In early 2021, an NFT created by Beeple was sold by Christie's for $69.3 million. It was a collage of 5000 digital images. In December of 2021, *Merge* was sold for $91.8 million.

CryptoPunks, one of the most well-known NFT projects, currently maintains a price floor of 64.69 ETH. In other words, the lowest priced CryptoPunks NFT is just under $200,000. <sup><a href="" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>

Since late 2019/early 2020, the NFT market has quite literally blown up. Prices of non-fungible tokens have soared through the roof, and the attention and hype surrounding them have reached unhealthy levels.

I recently attended the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, and pretty much half of the panels were either dedicated to NFTs or inevitably came around to discuss NFTs. It's a *sports analytics* conference.

Again, just as with cryptocurrency, NFTs have become an investment; it's not about buying them for the utility, it's about making money from them.

Yet again, however, that does not mean NFTs are without utilty. Nnon-fungible tokens are a blockchain-based technology, as cryptocurrency is. They are stored on the blockchain and can be traded the very same way. The primary difference is that non-fungible tokens are (as the name says) non-fungible.

This means that each NFT (a token) is uniquely identifiable, whereas most cryptocurrency tokens are not--they are undifferentiable and interchangeable. After all, this is because cryptocurrencies and NFTs serve different purposes.

The primary use of NFTs are to provide valididation of authenticity or proof of ownership. Due to their unique, differentiable nature, NFTs are most often paired with digital assets, with the NFT serving as not the product itself, but the "ownership" of the product.

Unfortunately, this does create some gray area: they are not legally binding, they do not necessarily convey copyright, and as many people have pointed out and memed, the digital assets assiocated with NFTs can be easily acquired without purchasing the NFT. 

I can see and download Beeple's $69 million artwork in full quality on Google images.

But what NFTs really do provide is a more digitized, secure manner of proving ownership. What do people do now to prove ownership of goods? 
Probably a legal document or something. What about a digital item? 

The current way people prove ownership of digital goods is quite complex and very much the opposite of seamless. NFTs certainly provide a much better way of proving ownership or authenticity and a much more secure way as well.

It's inevitable, really, as we move to a more digitized world that we will replace our outdated, complex, confusing methods of ownership. 

Because even the least digital things in our lives, such as our homes, have already moved to cyberspace.
