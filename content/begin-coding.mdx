It can be intimidating to start coding--justifiably so. However, despite its reputation as something very technical and specific, coding is actually quite a general skill that is becoming increasingly standard.

It's quite a useful skill, even if you aren't planning to do anything computer science-related. 

It's kind of like learning an actual language, but even more important, especially considering the trend towards digitization.

Plus, it's fun. 

## Which Language?

Obviously, the first step in learning to code is to figure out which programming language you want to start with. 

First of all, I want to make it clear that what you really want to learn as a beginner is the fundamentals, the concepts, the ideas. It's not about learning the language, it's about learning how to
code--learning a language is just learning the specific syntax and tailoring the general ideas to work with the language.

However, I still believe choosing the right langauge can still be beneficial. The two most critical things in a programming language for beginners (in my opinion) is learnability/simplicity and fundamentals.

That is to say, the language needs to be straightforward to be easily picked up, and it must also cover the crucial fundamentals of coding.

### Python

Python is currently the most used langauge, and definetely the most used beginner langauge--I don't think it's very close.

It has very English-like, readable syntax, no curly brackets, much less parentheses, no data types... you get the idea. It's a very simple, easily learnable language.

Yet, the same things that make it a very easily learnable langauge make it a language that misses many key computer science concepts/fundamentals that makes it difficult in the future past beginner levels and in learning new, more strict languages.

As a beginner (and not as a beginner), you can get away with dubious code in Python that wouldn't be allowed in other langauges. The most damaging aspect of this is the bad habits it develops. 

The possibility of developing bad habits is compounded even more if you are trying to learn Python yourself.

Python is just a bit too high-level.

What, then, should I be learning first?

### Java and C++

Starting at a lower-level language is definetely the best way in an ideal world, but too low-level and it might lose applicability or usefulness.

Learning Assembly first is just pretty difficult, not to mention something lacking in usefulness for most people.

So, a middle-of-the-road solution probably works best for most people--not too high-level, low-level enough to get the core fundamentals and develop good habits, and still immediately applicable/useful.

In this vein, Java and C++ probably fit these criteria best.

Both are object-oriented; both are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing" target="_blank">strongly typed</a>; both have comparatively weaker standard libraries than langauges like Python.
