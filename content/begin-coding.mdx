It can be intimidating to start coding--justifiably so. However, despite its reputation as something very technical and specific, coding is actually quite a general skill that is becoming increasingly standard.

It's quite a useful skill, even if you aren't planning to do anything computer science-related. 

It's kind of like learning an actual language, but even more important, especially considering the trend towards digitization.

Plus, it's fun. 

## Which Language?

Obviously, the first step in learning to code is to figure out which programming language you want to start with. 

First of all, I want to make it clear that what you really want to learn as a beginner is the fundamentals, the concepts, the ideas. It's not about learning the language, it's about learning how to
code--learning a language is just learning the specific syntax and tailoring the general ideas to work with the language.

However, I still believe choosing the right language can still be beneficial. The two most critical things in a programming language for beginners (in my opinion) is learnability/simplicity and fundamentals.

That is to say, the language needs to be straightforward to be easily picked up, and it must also cover the crucial fundamentals of coding.

### Python

Python is currently the most used language, and definitely the most used beginner language--I don't think it's very close.

It has very English-like, readable syntax, no curly brackets, much less parentheses, no data types... you get the idea. It's a very simple, easily learnable language.

Yet, the same things that make it a very easily learnable language make it a language that misses many key computer science concepts/fundamentals that makes it difficult in the future past beginner levels and in learning new, more strict languages.

As a beginner (and not as a beginner), you can get away with dubious code in Python that wouldn't be allowed in other languages. The most damaging aspect of this is the bad habits it develops. 

The possibility of developing bad habits is compounded even more if you are trying to learn Python yourself.

Python is just a bit too high-level.

What, then, should I be learning first?

### Java and C++

Starting with a lower-level language is definetely the best way in an ideal world, but too low-level and it might lose applicability or usefulness.

Learning Assembly first is just pretty difficult, not to mention something lacking in usefulness for most people.

So, a middle-of-the-road solution probably works best for most people--not too high-level, low-level enough to get the core fundamentals and develop good habits, and still immediately applicable/useful.

In this vein, Java and C++ probably fit these criteria best.

Both are object-oriented; both are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing" target="_blank">strongly typed</a>; both have comparatively weaker standard libraries than languages like Python.

## The Learning process

Within the last several years, many "coding bootcamps" have risen. Adding these with the plethora of already existing online coding courses, there has never been as many resources.

While bootcamps may be effective for learning a lot in a little amount of time, they just aren't worth it most of the time.  

Most of these bootcamps are no small financial commitment--many coding bootcamps can run you thousands of dollars over a couple of months.

Courses from massive open online course providers such as Coursera and Udemy aren't super cheap either (depending on who's instructing/offering the course), but are much more economical--I don't think $40 a month is unreasonable at all, for example (Deep Learning courses on Coursera).

But of course, the big question is whether self-learning is worth it.

Being a self-taught learner is much more difficult, takes a much greater time commitment, and is much easier to develop bad habits than learning directly in a structured setting.

That's not to say you can't still use free online lessons, but free lessons are always much less rigorous. And it's much more difficult to find good free ones.

In middle school and high school, I took Computer Science classes and went to programming camps--that's how I first learned to code Java.

But that's the only language I've ever had a proper education in; every other language I've coded, I taught myself how to.

My experiences have made the benefits and drawbacks of both sides fairly clear.

### Classes vs Self-taught

The biggest difference is in theory. If you want to learn the technical intricacies, the theory, the science--you'd be better off taking courses.

Unfortunately, these are the things that are most unintuitive and most detailed. Learning them on your own is much more difficult when you don't know where to begin, and it is easy to become overwhelmed or misinformed.

Other than that, there isn't a great difference in effectiveness, at least not to me. 

For application development, online resources are much more accessible (because it's easier). You don't need a teacher to guide you through everything,
just by looking at some code, you can work out how things work yourself.

And that's exactly what I often do when I learn a new language or when I learn a new technology (whether that's a framework or library or whatever).

There's also just the fact that learning how to learn on your own is a very good skill. Learning how to find solutions, utilize resources, parse documentation--these are things that developers need
to do anyways in professional settings, so the earlier you learn that the better.

## Enjoying it

But nothing helps more than just enjoying the process. 

It may not seem like it at first (I certainly didn't enjoy coding when I first began learning it), but as you do more and learn more, you might find it to be quite fun.

It's like a puzzle or a game: a fun challenge.

And if you can find meaning in coding--in accomplishment, in self-exploration/self-improvement, or in making things better, then that's even better. 

If you aren't enjoying yourself while coding, you're doing something wrong. Obviously, you can't enjoy something all the time, but it's not worth it if you can't find anything in it
beyond the letters, the numbers, the brackets, the methods, the objects.

Try coding things you like, things you care about. If you like playing video games, for example, try programming stuff related to video games. 

You won't believe how many progammers started that way--coding for something they already enjoyed.

I first discovered that I actually liked to code nearly two years after I had already begun, and it was because it was the first time I coded something
on my own, without somebody telling me what to code, for something I cared about.

That's why I sometimes stay up until 5AM to code. That's what will push you through to debug, improve, and create.
