description: NFTs, Cryptocurrency, NFTs, Blockchain. It's all you hear about these days. Your friend, your coworker and even your grandmother seem to know about them -- and actively "invest" in them. The world is obssessed with the "Blockchain," but do they even know what it is? Do you? I didn't.

It was 7 AM, a brisk, overcast Monday. 29 year old Rachel Siegel had left her Lower East Side apartment to the subway. She was on her way to the public school where she worked as a subsitute teacher.

8:30: First period. 9:30: Second period. And the next, and the next. Rachel sat in her classroom, talking to students, watching them. She ate lunch, and then resumed teaching for the afternoon classes.

It seemed to be another normal day in the life for a substitute teacher, but there was something different about this particular Monday for Rachel. A cryptocurrency conference was being held in New York City.

This in itself was nothing out of the ordinary, New York City had seen probably hundreds of similar conferences before, but to Rachel, it certainly was not an everyday occurence.

She had been invited to the conference's after-party by her friend, despite her never having paid much attention to cryptocurrency.

But at that conference, she met people who were experienced, passionate, and confident about cryptocurrency, and that's all it took for Rachel to become convinced in cryptocurrency as an investment.

She began her investments by taking whatever was left from her substitute teacher paycheck--often less than $25 a week.

Less than five years later, Rachel is a millionare. She recently flew first-class on Emirates to Dubai, a seat that normally costs no less than $10,000.
