One thing I knew I wanted to add to my blog when I was first creating it was a Table of Contents for each post. 

It's a lot better when a table of contents is present if you're searching for a particular thing within a blog post, especially if the blog post is long.

Unfortunately, adding a nice table of contents into your blog posts isn't as straightforward as using a package--at least not when using Next.

In Gatsby, you can use Gatsby's GraphQL plugin and it can give you a table of contents object from a Markdown/MDX file (if you're interested in MDX, check out [one of my previous posts](/posts/mdx-in-next)).

```js
import { graphql } from "gatsby";

// GraphQL query
const query = graphql`
  query SomeQuery($relativePath: String) {
    pageData: mdx(fields: { relativePath: { eq: $relativePath } }) {
      fields {
        slug
      }
      frontmatter {
        title
        description
        lang
      }
      body
      tableOfContents
    }
  }
`; // notice the `tableOfContents` in the query

// then you can access the table of contents in your React component
const Component = ({ data }) => {
    const mdx = data.pageData;
    const tableOfContents = mdx.tableOfContents.items;

    // rest of blog stuff here...
}

```

In Next, we'll need to do some hacking and manipulation ourselves.

## Finding the headers

In figuring out how to create a table of contents, we must decide what a table of contents is made up of.

In a book, it's chapters that make up the table of contents. For a blog post, it's up to you. 

The table of contents definitely needs the main section titles (whether that's an `<h1>` or `<h2>` or whatever). But if you want to also include the subheadings, then that's also great.

I only use 2 headings in my blogs: `<h2>` and `<h3>`, and I use both in my table of contents.

Like I said before, Markdown works very well with HTML: you can use HTML tags in Markdown, or you can use the Markdown equivalents (which is recommended).

Headers in Markdown are determined by the `#` character: a single pound symbol is equivalent to the `<h1>` tag, three pound symbols are equivalent to the `<h3>` tag -- you get the idea.

For instance, an H1 header in Markdown titled "Big header" would look like this: `# Big Header`.

And since headers are on their own lines, you can iterate through the lines of the files, use some regular expressions to figure out if the line is a header, and then extract the header names to later insert as elements of your table of contents.

```js
const headerRegExp = /^###*\s/;

function getTOC( rawText: string ) {
    const headingLines = rawText // `rawText` is a blog post's file content (not compiled by an MDX compiler)
        .split('\n')
        .filter((line) => {
            return line.match(headerRegExp); // only keep lines that are headers (begin with hashtags)
        })
        .map((line) => {
            return line.trim();
        });

    let tocArray = [];

    // iterate through each line
    headingLines.forEach((line) => {
        let header = line.replace(headerRegExp, '').trim(); // get rid of the hashtags at the beginning (this is the header title that will be displayed in the table of contents)
        let hashtagLoc = line.split(' ')[0]; // just in case the header has hashtags in it (for example, the header is `## #relatable` - the third hashtag is not part of the header tag, it's part of the actual header)
        const level = hashtagLoc.match(/#/g)||[]).length; //get number of #'s (figure out if it's h1, h2, etc.)
        if ([2, 3].includes(level)) // only using h2 and h3 in my blog
            tocArray.push({ header, level });
    });
    
    return tocArray;
}
```

You can then use this array of headers to create your own `TableOfContents` component.

```jsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export const TableOfContents: React.FC<{ textSource: string }> = ({ textSource }) => {
    const tocItems = getTOC(textSource);

    return (
        <div className='wrapper'>
            <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
            <div className='items'>
            {
                tocItems.map((header, index) => (
                    <Link href={'#'+slugify(header)} passHref><a>{header}</a></Link> // `slugify()` just replaces spaces with hyphens
                ))
            }
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

There's just one more thing that would top off this table of contents.

## Showing the active section

A last addition that would be great is to highlight, bold, or somehow show the user which section/header they are currently reading.

<!-- GIF/Video here -->

Luckily, most of the more difficult parts of the table of contents is done and this is a relatively straightforward addition to what we've already done.

We just need to add something that tracks all of the header slugs and checks which one is intersecting with the client's viewport.


```jsx
/**
 * @param header the raw header with the title and ID
 * @returns the slugified header title
 */
export function getHeaderID( header: string ) {
    headerID = slugify(headerID);
    return headerID;
}

function getTOC( rawText: string ) {
    const headingLines = rawText
        .split('\n')
        .filter((line) => {
            return line.match(headerRegExp);
        })
        .map((line) => {
            return line.trim();
        });

    let tocArray = [];
    let idArray = []; // we will use this array later

    headingLines.forEach((line) => {
        let header = line.replace(headerRegExp, '').trim(); 
        const id = getHeaderID(header); // get the header id
        let hashtagLoc = line.replace(`{#${id}}`, '').split(' ')[0];
        const level = (hashtagLoc.match(/#/g)||[]).length; 
        if ([2, 3].includes(level)) {
            tocArray.push({ header, id, level }); // add the header id to the object
            idArray.push(id);
        }
    })
    
    return { tocArray, idArray };
}

export const TableOfContents: React.FC<{ textSource: string }> = ({ textSource }) => {
    const toc = getTOC(textSource);
    const tocItems = toc.tocArray;
    const titleIds = toc.idArray;
    const activeHeader = useActiveHeader(titleIds); // we will create a React hook that will check which header is present in the viewport using the array of header IDs

    return (
        <div className='wrapper'>
            <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
            <div className='items'>
            {
                tocItems.map((header, index) => (
                    <Link href={'#'+slugify(header)} passHref className={activeHeader === slugify(header)?'active':''}> {/* If it is the active header apply a different style to the header*/}
                        <a>{header}</a>
                    </Link>
                ))
            }
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

All we've added is an array of header IDs, which in this case is just the slugified header (eg. `some header` becomes `some-header`).

Now we need to implement the <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html' target='_blank'>React hook</a> that will determine which header is currently in the viewport (and therefore which section they are currently reading).

```js
// hooks/useActiveHeader.js

import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";


/**
 * A hook to determine which section of the page is currently in the viewport.
 * @param {*} itemIds Array of document ids to observe
 * @param {*} rootMargin
 * @returns id of the element currently in viewport
 */
export const useActiveHash = (itemIDs: string[], rootMargin = `0% 0% -40% 0%`) => {
    const headingElementsRef = useRef({}); // https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref
    const [activeHeader, setActiveHeader] = useState(''); // https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate

    useEffect(() => { // https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect
        const callback = (entries) => {
            headingElementsRef.current = entries.reduce((map, headingElement) => { // creates a hashmap with heading elements' IDs as keys to the heading elements themselves
                map[headingElement.target.id] = headingElement;
                return map;
            }, headingElementsRef.current);

            let visibleHeadings = [];
            Object.keys(headingElementsRef.current).forEach((key) => { // iterate through the header elements and check if it is visible in the viewport
                const element = headingElementsRef.current[key];
                if (element.isIntersecting) { // checks if element is in viewport
                    visibleHeadings.push(element);
                }
            });

            if (visibleHeadings.length>0) { // set a header as the active header
                setActiveHeader(visibleHeadings[visibleHeadings.length-1].target.id);
            }
        };

        const observer = new IntersectionObserver( // initialize the IntersectionObserver
            callback,
            { rootMargin: rootMargin }
        );


        itemIDs.forEach((id) => { // add header elements to the IntersectionObserver if the header ID refers to a valid header
            if (document.getElementById(id) !== null) {
                observer.observe(document.getElementById(id));
            }
        });

        return () => { // unobserve everything and disconnect when no longer being used
            itemIDs?.forEach((id) => {
                if (document.getElementById(id) !== null) {
                    observer.unobserve(document.getElementById(id));
                }
            });
            observer.disconnect();
        }

    }, [itemIDs, rootMargin]);
    return activeHeader;
}
```

Finally, we need to make the items in the Table of Contents actually link to the proper header. Currently, if you click on an item in the table of contents, nothing probably happens.

That's because even though the headers link to stuff, the header elements do not yet have an ID themselves.

We need to give the header elements an ID: `<div id='some-id'>header</div>`. A simple way to do this is to create custom header components that we will pass to the MDXRemote renderer.

```jsx
// wherever you render the MDX (ie. pages/[slug].jsx in this example)

const Header2 = props => {
    <h2 id={slugify(props.children)}>
        {props.children}
    </h2>
}

const Header3 = props => {
    <h3 id={slugify(props.children)}>
        {props.children}
    </h3>
}
```

I mentioned this earlier, but you can provide custom components to next-mdx-remote (and most other MDX renderers). You can use these components two ways. The first, I already mentioned--you can add custom components to be used directly in the MDX file. 

The second one, however, is to replace standard HTML elements with custom ones. That's exactly what we need: we want to replace the standard h2 and h3 elements that next-mdx-remote usually compiles to with our custom `Header2` and `Header3` components.

So we add our header components together with next-mdx-remote's custom components, and...

```jsx
// pages/[slug].jsx

import { getBlogContent, getBlogPaths } from '@lib/blogData';
import Head from 'next/head';
import React from 'react';

const Header2 = props => {
    <h2 id={slugify(props.children)}>
        {props.children}
    </h2>
}

const Header3 = props => {
    <h3 id={slugify(props.children)}>
        {props.children}
    </h3>
}

const components = { 
    h2: Header2,
    h3: Header3
 } // map h2 and h3 to the custom components

// this is the actual blog page (the code)
const BlogPage: React.FC<{ blogData }> = ({ blogData }) => {
    return (
        <>
            <Head>
                <title>{blogData.title}</title>
            </Head>
            {/* Blog stuff (such as the title, the navigation menu, etc.) */}
            <MDXRemote {...blogData.code} components={components} /> {/* provide the `components` object to the renderer */} 
            {/* Other Blog stuff */}
        </>
    );
} 

// getStaticPaths() and getStaticProps() ...
```

... that's it. As someone who began working on this blog without too much experience with React/Next, having to implement many things myself and learn React hooks without the help of libraries seemed quite intimidating. 

But it turned out to be somewhat easier than I had originally envisaged. It just goes to show, if you know how to find resources, if you know how to learn, and if you've got the basic knowledge down, complicated things become very doable if you take some time.

The problem is that it's sometimes difficult to find straightforward, accessible, and aggregated useful content. 

I'm not a great JavaScript developer, and I'm not a great web developer, but it's fun, and I enjoy learning about it. 

Hopefully, if you were struggling with this, then this post helped at least a bit. Happy coding.
