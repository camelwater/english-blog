Just a couple of months ago, a piece of digital property in a virtual sandbox mobile game-turned-metaverse *The Sandbox* <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/investors-are-paying-millions-for-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse.html" target="_blank">sold for $4.3 million</a>. 

It was almost double the previous record for digital real estate, which happened only a week prior: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/virtual-real-estate-plot-sells-record-24-million-2021-11-23/" target="_blank">$2.4 million</a> for some estate in the *Decentraland* metaverse.

It seems ridiculous, spending that type of money on some land that isn't even land. *The Sandbox* is a sandbox (yeah, kind of like the name suggests) gaming platform, not all too dissimilar from *Minecraft*--and there's no way
anyone would have ever thought of dropping 7 figures on some dirt blocks during its heyday.

But things have changed, obviously.

Virtual online multiplayer games have existed for decades. People have been able to log on to digital worlds and build homes, create things, and interact with each other since the internet became widely accessible. 

So what's different now?

## The beginnings of the Metaverse

![The Metaverse](/assets/images/metaverse/metaverse-2.jpg "The Metaverse")

The term "metaverse" is an old one, originating from the 1992 science fiction novel *Snow Crash*. 

In *Snow Crash*, the Metaverse is an urban environment made to resemble the real world that can be accessed by humans through the use of Virtual Reality headsets.

Within the Metaverse, users appear as customizable avatars, and are able to interact with other humans and programmed agents in first-person.

A kind of similar premise, actually, to later science fiction stories that would follow (*The Matrix*, *Ready Player One*, etc.).

Then in 2003, <a href="https://secondlife.com/" target="_blank">*Second Life*</a> was released. A virtual world platform, *Second Life* was the world's first implemented metaverse. It incorporated many aspects of real life into a persistent 3D game:
you could buy real estate, play games, walk around, interact with other users on the platform all through your avatar. 

*Second Life* gained some traction, <a href="https://www.lindenlab.com/releases/infographic-10-years-of-second-life" target="_blank">peaking at around a million active monthly users</a> in 2013, but never became quite mainstream. (It is pretty boring; I tried it out a couple of years ago, and only played for about two hours.)

## Contemporary developments

On July 21, 2017, one of the biggest video games in history was released. *Fortnite* created a mania that had never been seen before in the video game industry,
becoming the most visible video game in history and propelling gaming to a new stratosphere.

It was a crucial development, as investment and mainstream media interest and coverage of video games skyrocketed, whereas in the past, gaming had always been a subculture.

*Fortnite* began as a simple shooter game, but the release of its "Creative Mode" saw the game change. "Creative Mode" allowed players to create their own maps and worlds and invite friends to play, or share their world by using a code.

This, combined with *Fortnite*'s existing customizable avatars and collectibles and virtual events and concerts (involving famous celebrities) that created gatherings of millions of players made saw *Fortnite* beginning to resemble *Second Life*.

On December 26, 2019, the CEO of Epic Games (the game studio behind *Fortnite*), <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1210291961904730114?lang=en" target="_blank"> tweeted</a>, "Fortnite is a game. But please ask that question again in 12 months." This was closely after *Fortnite* had organized an in-game concert, where millions of players
went into thousands of separate worlds to listen to a Marshmello concert in *Fortnite*.

Epic Games made their Metaverse aspirations clear: they saw *Fortnite* as a stepping stone to creating an immersive virtual platform.

*Roblox*, a game released in 2006, reached its peak popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roblox Studios too began to target a "Metaverse," and heavily marketed *Roblox* as one--*Roblox* players had been interacting in a world very much like *Second Life* for almost two decades on the game, and started to hold birthday parties and concerts on the platform as well.

Then in November of 2021, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html" target="_blank">announced that they would rename themselves</a> "Meta Platforms." It was clear that Meta saw the Metaverse as the future, and the company declared its primary commitment to develop one.

And that's when the Metaverse **really** blew up.

### VR/AR

Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality is one of the first things people think of when the "Metaverse" is mentioned. 

Indeed, it is one characteristic or implementation of a Metaverse, rather than the Metaverse itself.

In the last several years, big tech has invested heavily in the technology, well before the popularity of the Metaverse.

Facebook (now Meta) began their foray into the VR space with their <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/" target="_blank">acquisition of Oculus</a> back in 2014.

Microsoft acquired the VR company <a href="https://time.com/4967092/microsoft-altspacevr-virtual-reality/" target="_blank">AltspaceVR</a> in 2017, and Google began integrating AR experiences into the apps such as Google Maps years ago.

VR clearly had belief surrounding it, but whereas it used to be another small piece of technology that could be appended to these tech companies' existing products, it has now become a product itself--obviously a result of the Metaverse.

### Blockchain and Crypto

Another technology that stands to benefit massively is blockchain and its related technologies, such as crypto.

While cryptocurrency even now sees limited practical use (one of the chief criticisms leveled against it), the Metaverse provides an environment where cryptocurrency might be necessary.

No doubt this is a major factor in crypto's continued growth in 2021 and 2022.

Even more apparent is the proposed link between NFTs and the Metaverse. NFTs only gained mainstream popularity in 2020, and it too suffers from the same criticisms as cryptocurrency, but even more intensely.

Although in its current use, NFTs provide much less potential (and this perhaps may outweigh the effort/cost), it's much easier to see how they could be a part of a digital economy.

Tokens of ownership for Metaverse items, uses in contracts and agreements... there's a lot more potential.

### Digital Twins

The idea of creating perfect digital representations of physical items has been pursued after for many years by now. 

While NASA kickstared digital twins (real-time digital counterparts of physical objects) a decade ago for internal use in creating better simulations of spacecrafts, companies like Microsoft have been commercializing them, leading to increasing adoption.

Nvidia, meanwhile, has undertaken a more gargantuan task--to <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-digital-twin-platform-for-scientific-computing" target="_blank">model the whole world</a>.

Obviously, a digital twin model of the entire globe will be exceedingly difficult and is far from being finished, but the progress that has been made is impressive.

Maybe you can see the connection of a digital model of the world (and perhaps the universe in the future) and the digital world of the Metaverse?

The possibility it provides and its potential role is two-fold:
accurate digital models of the physical world like land (and people) will create infinitely more realistic, immersive experiences in a virtual world (the more obvious use), and 
digital models of the physical world will allow us to better monitor our physical world--better tracking of emissions, natural disasters, structural integrity of buildings, and so much more.

In essence, digital twins will not just create a better Metaverse, but a better Earth (and maybe more, if we ever get there).

## An expanding scope

The vision of the Metaverse has stayed relatively the same--a promise for an immersive, virtual-reality online world. A concept that has existed for decades.

It's still talked about in this limited scope of a VR world.

But the Metaverse has a far larger scope. 

It isn't just a VR headset world--those have existed for a long time now.

What it really envisions is a world that bridges the physical and the digital: an immersive, contextualized world catered to the individual--the next step
in virtual interaction.

Currently, our digital activities are very much limited by what platforms we use and what they offer. The internet is extremely siloed, requiring users to
carry with them many different credentials, currencies, technologies for each platform. 

And most of the time, what is used on one platform is unusable or worthless on another. There is no cross-game compatibility (I mean, some games now don't even offer cross-platform compatibility),
and each user experience is very detached from the other.

Imagine an internet where everything is connected; every app, every game, every platform has all the same rules, physics, technologies that can be inter-transferred. 

In the real world that's what happens. You don't have to learn new fundamental rules of physics or etiquette or language or anything because we are all human. We are not defined by the platform we are using, but the individual.

The Metaverse is a step in that direction--where the user experience rests on the *users themselves*, and that's where non-fungible tokens could play a massive role. 

In the short-term, the Metaverse could provide a great entertainment outlet or increased, detailed insights into the physical world at a level we've never had access to before.

In the long-term, the Metaverse is the gateway to perhaps a utopia. A massive world with infinite abundance without the need to expand our civilization outwards.

Of course, such an expansive plan will not be easy; impossible, in fact, some would say. 

But I think space is harder to explore than cyberspace.
