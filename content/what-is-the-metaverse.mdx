Just a couple of months ago, a piece of digital property in a virtual sandbox mobile game-turned-metaverse *The Sandbox* <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/investors-are-paying-millions-for-virtual-land-in-the-metaverse.html" target="_blank">sold for $4.3 million</a>. 

It was almost double the previous record for digital real estate, which happened only a week prior: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/virtual-real-estate-plot-sells-record-24-million-2021-11-23/" target="_blank">$2.4 million</a> for some estate in the *Decentraland* metaverse.

It seems ridiculous, spending that type of money on some land that isn't even land. *The Sandbox* is a sandbox (yeah, kind of like the name suggests) gaming platform, not all too dissimilar from *Minecraft*--and there's no way
anyone would have ever thought of dropping 7 figures on some dirt blocks during its heyday.

But things have changed, obviously.

Virtual online multiplayer games have existed for decades. People have been able to log on to digital worlds and build homes, create things, and interact with each other since the internet became widely accesible. 

So what's different now?

## The beginnings of the Metaverse

The term "metaverse" is an old one, originating from the 1992 science fiction novel *Snow Crash*. 

In *Snow Crash*, the Metaverse is an urban environement made to resemble the real world that can be accessed by humans through the use of Virtual Reality headsets.

Within the Metaverse, users appear as customizable avatars, and are able to interact with other humans and programmed agents in first-person.

A kind of similar premise, actually, to later science fiction stories that would follow (*The Matrix*, *Ready Player One*, etc.).

Then in 2003, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life" target="_blank">*Second Life*</a> was released. A virtual world platform, *Second Life* was the world's first implemented metaverse. It incorporated many aspects of real life into a peristent 3D game:
you could buy real estate, play games, walk around, interact with other users on the platform all through your avatar. 

*Second Life* gained some traction, <a href="https://www.lindenlab.com/releases/infographic-10-years-of-second-life" target="_blank">peaking at around a million active monthly users</a> in 2013, but never became quite mainstream. (It is pretty boring; I tried it out a couple of years ago, and only played for about two hours.)

## Contemporary developments

On July 21, 2017, one of the biggest video games in history was released. *Fortnite* created a mania that had never been seen before in the video game industry,
becoming the most visible video game in history and propelling gaming to a new stratosphere. 

It was a crucial development, as investment and mainstream media interest and coverage of video games skyrocketed, whereas in the past, gaming had always been a sub-culture.

*Fortnite* began as a simple shooter game, but the release of its "Creative Mode" saw the game change. "Creative Mode" allowed players to create their own maps and worlds and invite friends to play, or share their world by using a code.

This, combined with *Fortnite*'s existing customizable avatars and collectibles and virtual events and concerts (involving famous celebrities) that created gatherings of millions of players made Fortnite start to resemble *Second Life*.

On December 26, 2019, the CEO of Epic Games (the game studio behind *Fortnite*), <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1210291961904730114?lang=en" target="_blank"> tweeted, "Fortnite is a game. But please ask that question again in 12 months." This was closely after *Fortnite* had organized an in-game concert, where millions of players
went into thousands of separate worlds to listen to a Marshmello concert in *Fortnite*.

Epic Games made their Metaverse aspirations clear: they saw *Fortnite* as a stepping stone to creating an immersive virtual platform.

*Roblox*, a game released in 2006, reached its peak popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roblox Studios too began to target a "Metaverse", and heavily marketed *Roblox* as one--*Roblox* players had been interacting in a world very much like *Second Life* for almost two decades on the game, and started to hold birthday parties and concerts on the platform as well.

Then in November of 2021, Facebook <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/technology/facebook-meta-name-change.html" target="_blank">announced that they would rename themselves</a> "Meta Platforms." It was clear that Meta saw the Metaverse as the future, and the company declared its primary commitment to develop one.

And that's when the Metaverse blew up.

Facebook began their foray into the VR space with their <a href="" target="_blank">acquisition of Oculus</a> back in 2014.

## Criticisms

## An expanding scope

The vision of the Metaverse has stayed relatively the same--a promise for an immersive, virtual-reality online world. A concept that has existed for decades.

It's still talked about in this limited scope of a VR world.
